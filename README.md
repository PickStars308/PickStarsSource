# Thanks List

# Notes
- The translation is based on the English version of the game, so there may be some differences in the translation.
- If you find any errors in the translation, please submit an issue or pull request to the repository.
 - If you want to contribute to the translation, please submit a pull request to the repository.

    - > 帮助我们翻译 -> Assist Translations

    - > 给您带来更好的体验 ->Bring a better experience

- When translating, "%s", "%d", etc. in the text are placeholders. Please do not delete or change them
- Please do not change the field order in the XML
